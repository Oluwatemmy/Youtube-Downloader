## üìÅ Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Oluwatemmy/Youtube-Downloader.git](https://github.com/Oluwatemmy/Youtube-Downloader.git)
    cd Youtube-Downloader
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended)**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## üîß Installing ffmpeg

This script requires `ffmpeg` to merge audio and video streams. Follow the instructions below for your operating system:

**Windows:**

1.  Download the latest stable build from [https://ffmpeg.org/download.html](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).
2.  Extract the ZIP file to a location on your computer (e.g., `C:\ffmpeg`).
3.  Add the `bin\` folder inside the extracted directory to your system's `PATH` environment variable.
4.  Verify the installation by opening a new command prompt and running:

    ```bash
    ffmpeg -version
    ```

**macOS (with Homebrew):**

1.  If you don't have Homebrew installed, you can install it from [https://brew.sh/](https://brew.sh/).
2.  Open your terminal and run:

    ```bash
    brew install ffmpeg
    ```

**Ubuntu/Linux:**

1.  Open your terminal and run:

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install ffmpeg
    ```

## üöÄ Usage

Run the script from the terminal:

```bash
python downloader.py
```

You'll be prompted to paste a YouTube video or playlist URL and select a resolution from the available options.

The downloaded file will be saved in the downloads/ folder inside the current directory.

## üß† How It Works
1. **User Input:** The script prompts the user for a YouTube video or playlist URL and a desired resolution.
2. **Video Information:** It uses `yt-dlp` to fetch video information, including available formats and the best resolution without downloading the actual content initially.
3. **List available Resolutions:** The script lists available resolutions and allows the user to select one.
5. **Resolution Selection:** The user selects their preferred resolution from the provided list.
6. **Duplicate Check:** The script checks if the video has already been downloaded by comparing the video ID with existing files in the `downloads/` directory.
7. **Download:** If the video hasn't been downloaded, it uses `yt-dlp` to download the video in the selected resolution and save it in the `downloads/` directory.
8. **Progress Display:** The script displays the download progress, including speed and estimated time of arrival (ETA).
9. **Error Handling:** If an error occurs during the download, the script retries the download up to 3 times before giving up.
10. **Completion Message:** Once the download is complete, the script informs the user and provides the path to the downloaded file.
11. **Exit:** The script exits after the download is complete.

## Output
Downloads are saved to:
```bash
<your-project-root>/downloads/
```
The filenames are cleaned to remove invalid characters, ensuring they are readable and compatible with most operating systems.

## ‚ùó Troubleshooting
### ffmpeg not found?
Make sure:
* `ffmpeg` is installed correctly to your system.
* The `bin` directory of `ffmpeg` is added to your system's `PATH` environment variable(for Windows).
* Restart your terminal or command prompt after making changes to the `PATH` variable.
* If you still encounter issues, try running `ffmpeg -version` in your terminal to verify the installation.
### yt-dlp not found?
Make sure:
* `yt-dlp` is installed correctly in your Python environment.
* You can check if `yt-dlp` is installed by running `yt-dlp --version` in your terminal.
* If you see an error, try reinstalling `yt-dlp` using `pip install -U yt-dlp`.
### Error during download?
The script includes basic error handling and will attempt retries automatically in some cases. 
Common issues include:
* `Network connectivity problems:` Check your internet connection and try again.
* `Invalid URL:` Ensure the URL you provided is correct and accessible.
* `Video unavailable:` The video may have been removed or set to private. Try a different URL.
* `Age-restricted content:` Some videos may be age-restricted. You may need to log in to your YouTube account to access them. You can do this by providing your cookies file using the `--cookies` option in `yt-dlp`.
*`Outdated yt-dlp version:` Ensure you have the latest version of `yt-dlp` installed. You can update it using:
```bash
pip install -U yt-dlp
```
If you encounter persistent errors, please check the yt-dlp documentation or issue tracker for potential solutions.
